### Belief System

* Keep it real.
* Always be learning.
* No is temporary, yes is forever.
* Mistakes are fine, but lack of effort isn't.
* Write the code that's needed at this moment.
* The more a component does, or the more specific a component is, the harder it is to reuse.
* Commit to a process, not a goal.
* Be very careful about trying to become happier than happy.
* How you do anything is how you do everything.
* Invest in helping those who need vs. investing in having more than you need.
